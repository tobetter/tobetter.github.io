## Quick start
The document in this page provides instructions to install/update OS images and to help to use them for your purposes on ODROID SBC of Hardkernel. The commands in the documents would not be compatible or equivalent to the contents in the ODROID Wiki since the OS images provided through this page offer the Linux upstream kernel, its configuration and features are different.

## Method of OS installation
We offer two installation methods - prebuilt server image and Netboot Installer.The general way to provide OS image for SBC today is to provide the customized complete image file that can boot immediately once it's been flashed to memory card - eMMC or SD card. Unlike this, but like what we are doing with PC, 'unofficial' Netboot Installer is also provided.
